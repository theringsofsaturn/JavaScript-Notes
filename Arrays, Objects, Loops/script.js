// Ternary Operator
// Shorter version of an if statement, it returns also a value

const age = 19;

// if age is greater than 18 price will hold "20$" as a value, otherwise it will hold "15$"	
const price = age > 18 ? "20$" : "15$";

// simple example
x = 10
let ternaryOperator = x > 10 ? true : false;

// the same as with if statemen example
if (x > 10) {
	ternaryOperator = true
} else {
	ternaryOperator = false
}

// Truthy and Falsy
// In JS some values are evaluated as true or false even though they aren't booleans. Here is just one example:

// empty string is evaluated as a false value
const truthyOrFalse = "" ? "truthy" : "falsy";

// The following values are always falsy:

// false
// 0 (zero)
// '' or "" (empty string)
// null
// undefined
// NaN
// Everything else is truthy.

// === and ==
// Unexpected situations can occur when comparing truthy and falsy values using the ==. It is always better to use in JS the triple equality === (or !== for the inequality), because it is a strict equality check.

console.log(2 == '2');
console.log(2 === '2');

// Let vs const


// const stands for constant. While a variable (let) could vary its value as the program flow proceeds, 
// constants point at the same value for as long as they lives. So it does mean that you can't reassign a value two times when using const!

let myVar = 0
const myConst = 0

myVar = 3 // this is allowed
myConst = 3 // this is NOT allowed


// Objects
// Numbers, boolean and strings are like the atoms that compose our data. 
// Many types of information require more complex structures, though. 
// Objects let us group together simple data types into a single structure.

const user = {
	name: "John", // string property
	surname: "Rambo", // another string property
	age: 18, // numeric property
	isStudent: true, // boolean property
};

// Properties
// You can access to objects properties in two ways: dot notation and square brackets.

console.log(user.name); // "John"
console.log(user["name"]); // same result

// In the same way you can change the values of the properties too

user.name = "Roger"; // equivalent to user["name"] = "Roger";

console.log(user.name); // "Roger"


// Delete Properties
// If you need to delete some properties from your objects you can use the reserved keyword delete in front of the object and his property

delete user.name;

console.log(user.name); // undefined

// Object.assign
// let obj2 = obj1 is not enough to clone an object, because there will always be an unwanted bind between the two. 
// A preferrable way to copy all the properties from an object into another one is the following

let obj1 = {
	name: "John"
}

let obj2 = {}

Object.assign(obj2, obj1); // assign obj2 to obj1

console.log(obj2.name); // "John"

//  Arrays
// â€ŒJS as many other programming languages provides a way to store sequentially some data. 
// It is called array and is written as a list of values between square brackets, each one separated by commas

let listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]; // array of numbers
let listOfNames = ["John", "Arnold", "Chuck"]; // array of strings
let listOfBools = [true, false, false, false, true]; // array of booleans

// We can access to a specific element of the array by using its index, or position in the list, surrounded again by square brackets 

// N.B. arrays' indexes start from zero!

console.log(listOfNumbers[0]); // 2
console.log(listOfNumbers[1]); // 3
console.log(listOfNumbers[4]); // 11

// What happens if you try to log array element with index 5 or above?

// Arrays of objects
// We can have arrays of any type, even containing advanced types like objects

const users = [
	{
		name: "John",
		surname: "Rambo",
	},
	{
		name: "Arnold",
		surname: "Schwarzenegger",
	},
	{
		name: "Chuck",
		surname: "Norris",
	},
]; // an array of three elements, each one of them is an object with two properties

console.log(users[0]); // {name: "John", surname: "Rambo"}
console.log(users[2].surname); // "Norris"

// Useful arrays methods

// Push and pop are array methods which can be used to add or remove elements to and from the end of an array

// push

const myArray = [1, 2, 3]

myArray.push(4)
myArray.push(5)

console.log(myArray) // [1,2,3,4,5]

pop
console.log(myArray.pop()) // removes the last element

console.log(myArray) // [1,2,3,4]

// We can search for a specific value with indexOf() and lastIndexOf(), they both return the index of the first occurance 
// if found or -1 if not found. The difference between the two is that lastIndexOf starts from the end of the array, 
// so if two elements are duplicated it returns just the first occurance

// indexOf

console.log(myArray.indexOf(1)); // 0
lastIndexOf
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 6]
console.log(myArray.lastIndexOf(1)); // 5

// Slice method can be used to return just a part of an array, you can specify a start index and optionally an end index. 
// If end index is not specified the array will be sliced till the last element

slice
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

console.log(myArray.slice(2, 4)); // [3,4]
console.log(myArray.slice(2)); // [3,4,5]




// The concat method can be used to glue arrays together to create a new array

concat
let list = [1, 2, 3, 4,].concat([5, 6, 7, 8]) // list becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] 

// Loops
// Loops allow developers to shorten what could be hundreds of lines of code to just a few 
// by repeating same or similar lines of code over multiple iterations

// While Loop

// Looping control flow allows us to go back to some point in the program where we were before and repeat it with our current program state. 
// If we combine this with a variable that counts, we can do something like



let number = 0;
while (number <= 10) {
	console.log(number);
	number = number + 1;
}


// A statement starting with the while keyword followed by parenthesis containing an expression is a loop. 
// The loop keeps entering that statement as long as the expression produces a value that gives true

// For Loop

// For loop in JS:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
	console.log(i);
}

// Output:
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4

// The round parenthesis of a for loop contain three main parts. 
// The first one is the initialization of the variable from which the loop will start "counting", -->> let i = 0
// the second one is the condition thta checks whether the loop must continue or not. -->> i < 5;
// Finally the third one is used to update the variable on each iteration of the loop. -->>  i++

// Breaking out of a loop
// A for loop finishes usually when the condition in the round parenthesis becomes false. 
// There is also a reserved keyword used to force exit from a loop even though the condition is still false, this keyword is break

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
	if (i === 3) break;
	console.log(i);
}

 // Output:
 // 0
 // 1
 // 2
