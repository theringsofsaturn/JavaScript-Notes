// Template Literals
// Remember this? 

console.log("Hello Strivers I am a string!");
console.log('Hello Strivers I am a string too!');
console.log(`Hello Strivers I have backticks but I am a string too!`);


// We said that strings in JS can be declared also with backticks --> `

// They are called template literals.



// With template literals you can 'break' strings into multiple lines. 
// You can also insert variables and expressions using the ${ } syntax. 
// They are a more modern and handy way to interact with text in JS

const name = "Tom"
const email = `Dear ${name},
				since Iâ€™m using template literals, I can go to a new line`
