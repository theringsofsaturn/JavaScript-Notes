// How to use Date objects in Javascript:
// MDN reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/it/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date



// the way in which we can extract the current date and time is by invoking the Date() constructor:

let now = new Date();


// we also have methods to use with Date objects such as: 

now.getFullYear();
now.getMonth();
now.getDate();
that will return respectively:

// year number (eg. 1970)
// month number (from 0 to 11), I know, very strange indeed!
// the day number (from 1 to 31)
